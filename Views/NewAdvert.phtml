                    First, I need your e-mail address. If somebody reacts to your offer, you'll get an e-mail, so you
                    can accept it.

                        Your e-mail will be saved in our database until your advert is deleted (by you or automatically
                        on its expiration) and will never be forwarded to any third parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, your e-mail will never be displayed publicly anywhere. When somebody reacts to your
                        advert, they won't be displayed this address. Instead, they'll fill&nbsp;in a contact form and
                        the message will be forwarded to you by our server. You can then choose whether you reply to the
                        person and let them know your e-mail address or not.

                    Now, I need you to tell me about the exam date you're offering. The easiest and most accurate
                    way to do it is to share the link to details of your exam date.
